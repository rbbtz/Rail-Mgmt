# Rail-Mgmt

This program creates two tables, train_details and bookings, and populates them with sample data. The train_details table stores details about the trains, including their station codes, names, arrival and departure times, distance between stations, and source and destination stations. The bookings table stores details about booked tickets, including the train number, source and destination stations, passenger name, and booking date.

The program also demonstrates how to perform various tasks using SQL, such as booking a ticket, canceling a booked ticket, checking fares before booking, and checking bookings.

You can save this program in a file and execute it using a MySQL client or command line interface. You can also modify it to add more functionality or customize it to your specific needs.
